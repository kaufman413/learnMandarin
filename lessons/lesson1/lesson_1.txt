Text: In this lesson you will learn some basic words. Note that the word 吗 (ma) is put at the end of a statement in order to make it a question. For example "You like apples ma?" Also, verbs are not conjugated in Chinese. So, the word 是 (shì) is translated as "be" but can mean "is", "are", or "am".
