你好, we're going to play a game. You have to guess what I am. Ask me ANYTHING.
1. 你是爸爸吗?
-Ohhhh, so close.
--But nope! 我不是爸爸。
--1. 你是妈妈吗?
---Yeah I thought you might ask that.
--2. 你是我吗?
---Hmm.. No, I doubt it.
2. 你是妈妈吗?
-Wow, super smart guess.
--But actually, 我不是妈妈。
--1. 你是我吗?
---Hmm.. No, I doubt it.
--2. 你是爸爸吗?
---Wow, again such a super smart guess.
Okay, one last chance to guess.
1. 你不是妈妈 AND 你不是爸爸。
-That's correct!
--So what does that make me?
--1. Yeah that sucks.. being a 妈妈 or a 爸爸 is the only way to live.
---Wow, you're mean.
--2. Cheer up! I'm also not a 妈妈 or a 爸爸. And it's great!
---Wow, that makes me feel a lot better.
2. 我爱你。
-You were thinking it too?
--But maybe we should come back to this when we know each other better.
--1. 好啊, I guess you're right.
---(好啊 just means okay. 好=good and 啊 is a "particle showing affirmation" according to google translate.)
--2. 不好! 我爱你!
---Okay, well that's enough of that.
So now I just want to test you on a few words. What does 爱 mean?
1. love
-Nice!
2. good
-Not nice! But you'll get it next time.
What does 是 mean?
1. be
-Nice!
2. not
-Not nice! But you'll get it next time.
What does 我 mean?
1. you

2. I
-Nice!
How do you write mom?
1. 爸爸
-Not nice! But you'll get it next time.
2. 妈妈
-Nice!
Okay so usually I'll give you a different amount of points depending on how you did but since it's your first time..
