你好, I want to 买 a pet, but I won't have much time or 钱 to take care of it. Can you help me?
1. 买狗！
-Hmmm, a 狗？Okay..
-pet := 狗
2. 买猫！
-A 猫？That seems like a 好 idea.
-pet := 猫
Okay, now I need to get something for it to 喝. There's 牛奶 and 水. Which should I get?
1. 买水！
-好, 水seems less expensive.
-drink := 水
2. 买牛奶！
-I think cats like 牛奶..
-drink := 牛奶
--Do you like to 喝牛奶?
--1. I love to 喝牛奶！
---ok
--2. 喝牛奶？Maybe if I were a 牛..
---cool
One more thing, I need to get something for it to 吃. Should I 买饭 or 买鱼？
1. 饭很好！
-food := 饭
2. 鱼很好！
-food := 鱼
好, so I bought a ${pet}, some ${drink} for it to 喝, and some ${food} for it to 吃.
1. 你觉得什么?
-if pet == 猫 and drink != 牛奶 and food != 鱼:
-I love my 猫！
-exp := 30
-if pet == 狗 and drink == 牛奶 and food == 鱼:
-I like my 狗, but I don't quite have enough time or 钱. Especially while feeding it 牛奶 and 鱼.
-exp := 5
-if pet == 猫 and drink == 牛奶 and food == 鱼:
-Hmmm..
--My 猫 loves the 牛奶 and 鱼 and I love my 猫！But I don't quite have enough 钱 to sustain its habits..\nWill you give me some 钱？
--1. I don't have 钱 for you!
---Understandable..
---exp := 20
--2. Sure.
---谢谢，thanks!
---exp := 50
-if pet == 狗 and drink != 牛奶 and food != 鱼:
-It's a cool 狗, I just don't have much time for it..
-exp := 20
