你好, I want to 买 a pet, but I won't have much time or 钱 to take care of it. Can you help me?
1. 买狗！
	Hmmm, a 狗？Okay..
	pet := 狗
2. 买猫！
	A 猫？That seems like a 好 idea.
	pet := 猫 
Okay, now I need to get something for it to 喝. There's 牛奶 and 水. Which should I get?
1. 买水！
	好, 水seems less expensive.
	drink := 水 
2. 买牛奶！
	drink := 牛奶
		I think cats like 牛奶.. Do you like to 喝牛奶?
		1. I love to 喝牛奶！
		2. 喝牛奶？Maybe if I were a 牛..
One more thing, I need to get something for it to 吃. Should I 买饭 or 买鱼？

好, so I bought a ${pet}, some ${drink} for it to 喝, and some ${food} for it to 吃.

    if vars == 猫，牛奶，鱼:
    Hmmm..
        My 猫 loves the 牛奶 and 鱼 and I love my 猫！But I don't quite have enough 钱 to sustain its habits..\nWill you give me some 钱？
